## Step 4 Loginto ieng6
The key that I pressed for this step is basically `<command+c>`,`<command +v>`,`<enter>` for copy and paste the account and another same keys `<command+c>`,`<command +v>`,`<enter>`for password
because I have already stored my ieng6 accound and password into a note in my macbook.
The command that I copied is `ssh cs15lsp23ok@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and my password. After copy and paste each time, I can log into my ieng6 account without typing by myself.

## Step 5 clone repository
The key that I pressed for step 5 is also copy and paste which is `<command+c>`  `<command +v>` and `enter` because the `git clone` command is provided within the lab description.The command 
that I copied and pasted is `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` The screenshot is as following:

## Step 6 Run test and Demonstrate that they failed
For this step,I have made several key entered because we need to change the directory to the lab7 directory and run the bash script of test. The keys I entered were `cd lab7`, `ls`, `bash test`, and `bash test.sh`.
For these steps, I have make a mistake of bash script because I forget to add .sh at the end of the test.sh file. For all the other keys they are basically changing directory, list the files, and running the 
Junit test.

## Step 7 Edit the code to fix the test
Indeed, in this step, keys that I pressed were `vim ListExamples.java` then move the cursor to the specific line we need to modify and press `i` to change to insert mode and then modify index1 to index2. 
Then `:wq` to save and exit the code file.

## Step 8 Running Test again
Now, to run these tests again, I can use` bash test.sh` to run overall test again.

## Step 9 Git commit and push
The keys that I pressed for this step were `git commit -a` then use `i` and modify the comment to `finish lab` after that `:wq` to save and exit vim mode.
Then I typed `git push` to push the change into my repository. I have to remodify the autherization key in order to push into my github. The following the one I have done from lab
